            <article>
                <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Pokrandt! This is my website, where all of my best projects are showcased! I got into coding late in high school, when my mentor, also into computers, noted that I had certain qualities that might make me a good coder, such as problem-solving and logical reasoning. I then graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Emmaus Bible College in 2020, with a 4.0 GPA. I currently live on the East side of Madison.</p>
                <p>Hobbies of mine include biking all over town, other outdoors fun including hiking, and solving every kind of puzzle in existence, including jigsaws, sudokus, crosswords and many others! I also enjoy playing games, reading, and watching videos on YouTube.</p>
