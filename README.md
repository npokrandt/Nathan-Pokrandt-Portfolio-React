# Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio. This is rendered using React, and loosely based on a portfolio I wrote earlier in the bootcamp. It is purely front-end, for now

## Usage

 On each page is a header and a footer. The header contains my name and links to the other pages (via react Link). The highlighted link indicates the page the user is viewing.

The default page is the "about me" page. This shows my avatar, and provides a short bio.

The portfolio page shows six of my best projects. Each project has a picture of the project, the name of the project, and links to each project's deployment and github repo.

The Contact page simulates a method to contact me. The user inputs their name, email and a short message. When they are ready, they push the submit button, and are notified that their message was sent. Each input field resets itself

Finally, the Resume page includes a link to my resume, which also automatically downloads the resume to the user's computer. Also included is a list of my proficiencies.

At the bottom of any of the pages is a footer. It has links to my linkedIn page, my github page, and my facebook page.

## Notes

Obviously my projects aside from the tech blog, my bio, and some color design is borrowed from my older portfolio. Aside from that the code is unique.
